\section{Puppet Markov Chain}

First of all let's define the Markov Chain that we want to analyze:

   \caption{On the left the graphical reppresentaion of our Markov Chain and on the right its transition matrix}
\end{figure}

We initialize the Markov Chain setting its initial state to 1 and defining its state space:

```{r, include = TRUE}
#Markov Chain Initializzation
state_space = c(1,2,3)
X_0 = 1
sample_size = 1000
```

We now define
